**Why do you want to join GDG FOSS Wing?**: Honestly, one of the main reasons I want to join isn't just to learn, but also to eventually share what I know. I've been a junior myself, so I get how much it helps to have someone guide you. Being able to give back and help new people find their footing in open source would be incredibly rewarding.

**Any other wing(s) you have applie to?**: Creative(Design) wing.

**Are you interested in participating in any of the global open-source programs like GSoC, LFX, Outreachy, SOB etc? If yes, mention it**: Yes, I'm really interested in GSoC, Outreachy, and SOB. To be honest, the money is a huge factor. But it's not just about the paycheck. When a program offers a high stipend, it tells me that the work is serious and the projects are important. It shows they're investing in the people who do the work. I want to be a part of a program like that because I know it will push me to learn and grow more than anything else. It's a chance to really challenge myself and build something meaningful.

**Anything else you would like to share (Links, projects, PRs or something else) with us?**: No.
