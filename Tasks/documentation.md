I came across Linux when I started exploring programming and open-source communities. At first, it felt a little intimidating because everything looked different from what I was used to on Windows. But once I started using it, I realized how much control and freedom it gives me.

What I enjoy the most about Linux is working in the terminal. Typing simple commands like ls or cd to move around, or using grep to search through files, makes me feel like I’m directly talking to the system. Slowly, I got used to writing small shell scripts, and it felt satisfying to automate tasks that I would normally repeat again and again.

I usually use Ubuntu because it is easy to set up and beginner-friendly, but I have also tried other distributions like Fedora and Debian just out of curiosity. Each distro feels slightly different, and that makes me appreciate how flexible Linux really is. Even on older laptops, Linux runs without any problems, which I find amazing.

Another thing that inspires me about Linux is the community. Whenever I get stuck, I can find solutions on forums, blogs, or even from people willing to help on open platforms. That sense of collaboration and knowledge sharing is what makes Linux special, and it’s one of the reasons I got more interested in open source.

For me, Linux is not just an operating system—it’s more like a learning partner. It pushes me to explore, make mistakes, fix them, and understand how things work behind the scenes. It has also introduced me to other open-source tools like Git and Docker, which I am now learning.

In short, Linux has changed the way I look at technology. It has made me more curious, independent, and confident as a learner.
